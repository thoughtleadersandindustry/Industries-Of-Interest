# Banking Images

This folder contains visual assets related to the banking and financial services industry. These images are used to support case studies, articles, and other written content throughout the **Industries-Of-Interest** repository. 

# *For .webp images you will need to view the raw file to see the image*

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to organize client-approved visuals that complement and enhance the presentation of banking-related resources. Images may include marketing collateral, user interface examples, social media graphics, branch photos, infographics, and more.

## Guidelines

- Only upload images you have permission to use (e.g., client-provided, original content, royalty-free).
- Use descriptive, hyphenated filenames (e.g., `digital-banking-app-interface.jpg`, `branch-front-tulsa.jpg`).
- If an image corresponds to a specific `.md` file (like a case study or blog post), include a comment or reference in that file using a relative path:
  ```markdown
  ![Mobile Banking Interface](../Images/digital-banking-app-interface.jpg)
