# Architecture Images

This folder contains images and visual assets related to architectural projects featured in the **Industries-Of-Interest** repository.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide high-quality, relevant images that complement project descriptions, case studies, and other architectural resources. These visuals help illustrate the work and give additional context to the written material.

## Guidelines

- All images must be used with permission or be original content.
- Filenames should be clear and descriptive.
- Images should relate directly to projects or articles included in the `Projects` subfolder.
- If possible, include image credits or source information in the related project `.md` file.

## How to Add Images

1. Upload images to this `Images` folder using the GitHub web interface or Git.
2. Organize images in subfolders if needed (e.g., by project name).
3. Reference the images in the related `.md` files using relative paths:
   ```markdown
