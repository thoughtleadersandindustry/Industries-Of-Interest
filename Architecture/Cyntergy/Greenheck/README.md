## About Greenheck

Greenheck is a leading manufacturer of ventilation, air movement, and air conditioning equipment, founded in 1947. Their products are used in factories, hospitals, schools, commercial kitchens, laboratories, stadiums, and many other building types—essentially anywhere reliable air flow, indoor air quality, and climate control matter. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

They provide detailed project profiles and technical resources for architects and engineers, helping AEC firms choose the right ventilation and air quality systems to meet both design goals and performance needs. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Why Greenheck Matters for Cyntergy

- **Product integration:** Greenheck’s ventilation systems are often critical components in architectural and mechanical systems for building comfort, safety, and sustainability.
- **Collaboration potential:** Cyntergy may interface with or specify Greenheck systems in their designs, especially for healthcare, educational, or commercial facilities where indoor air quality is key.
- **Project synergy:** Greenheck publishes detailed project profiles (for example, hospital, educational, and recreational facility installations) that can inform best practices or case study reference points for Cyntergy’s own AEC projects. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
